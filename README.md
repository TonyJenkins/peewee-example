# peewee-example

Simple example of using:

* SQLite (https://sqlite.org).
* Peewee ORM (http://docs.peewee-orm.com and https://pypi.org/project/peewee/).
* The ``template`` package from PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/template/).

See ``requirements.txt`` for the dependencies. These need to be installed before creating the database and running the scripts.

Note than on opening the project in PyCharm for the first time it will spot the ``requirements.txt`` and offer to create the virtual environment, install the dependencies, configure the interpreter, and so on.
